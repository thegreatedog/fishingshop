    description:
      'The Azura Safina X series began with four models of light and ultralight classes. In a short time, it became a real bestseller thanks to the outstanding characteristics of the rods. At the numerous requests of our customers, the line was significantly expanded and includes models of almost all classes, up to heavy. Safina X - specialized jig rods. When wiring, the blanks work only at the top, allowing you to perform complex tricks of jig animation. With more significant loads, the middle part is included in the work, giving the opportunity to make a long throw and bring out the fish that is actively resisting. The rigid komlev part has a solid reserve of power, which allows you to force balancing if necessary. Unpolished blanks without paint coating, made with the use of high-modulus Toray 40T graphite, are reinforced along the entire length with an additional cross-shaped X4 braid, due to which the series received the index X. The coating increases the rigidity, strength, and reliability of the fishing rod, and also helps to preserve the round cross-section of the blank, even with a strong bend. Azura Safina-X rods have a high sensitivity, both visual and tactile, which makes it possible to perform fully controlled wiring of the lightest jig baits. At the same time, they do not fail when casting and when wiring heavier baits, thus providing a very large real test range. The rods look very light and elegant, as for their test, while all models allow you to comfortably work with baits whose weight is approaching its upper limit. WeBos lightest pass rings help realize the potential of the blank. The extended handle is equipped with a spool holder, the design of which maximizes tactile sensitivity. Any model of the series is a great tool for a fan of jig fishing. Choose your Safina X!AZSF-70UL - a classic micro jig rod. Equipped with a hollow, but at the same time very informative top.',

    name: ' Flagman Magnum Black Carp Tele NGM 3.3Ð¼',
    description:
      'Flagman Magnum Black Carp NGM Tele New is an updated series of popular budget-class telescopic carp rods that have proven themselves well among our fishermen. The rods have stylish matte black blanks, made of modern composite materials, and are endowed with all the necessary characteristics for successful fishing of large and strong fish. Flagman Magnum Black Carp NGM Tele New blanks have retained their power and stiffness, which positively affects their casting characteristics. An increase in the casting range is also facilitated by the use of increased diameter rings in black frames (the first ring is 40 mm) in updated rods, which practically do not create resistance during the passage of the line and give the products a modern, stylish look. The coil mounting unit has also undergone a change: now it is a higher-quality and reliable coil holder of a classic design. Magnum Black Carp NGM Tele rods have a medium-slow action, which allows not only to make successful power castings, but also significantly increases the ability of blanks to extinguish sudden jerks of fish and bend along the entire length when weighing trophy specimens. The telescopic design of the blanks facilitates storage and transportation, and the spread handle made of EVA, which now completely covers its lower part, contributes to a more reliable holding of the rod during casting. The undoubted advantages of updated Flagman Magnum Black Carp rods also include their high quality and affordable price for a wide range of carp fishing enthusiasts.',
